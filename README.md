DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION :

     As part of my internship at CodTech, I was assigned Task 1 to demonstrate my understanding and application of SQL JOIN operations. This task focused on combining data from two related tables using different types of JOINs—INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

To fulfill the task, I created two sample tables:

Employees: Contains employee details such as employee ID, name, and department ID.

Departments: Contains department IDs and corresponding department names.

Using these tables, I performed the following SQL JOINs:

INNER JOIN – Retrieved records with matching department IDs in both tables.

LEFT JOIN – Retrieved all employee records, including those without a matching department.

RIGHT JOIN – Retrieved all department records, including those with no employees.

FULL OUTER JOIN – Combined results from both LEFT and RIGHT JOIN to include all records from both tables, matched where possible.

The output of each query demonstrates how JOINs can be used to merge data meaningfully and handle missing or unmatched relationships between tables.

This task improved my practical skills in SQL and helped me understand the importance of JOINs in database management and data analysis.

OUTPUTS:
